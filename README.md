# A Vending Machine

ADP Summer 2018, Adam Roerick

## What is it?

_Do you actually not know what a vending machine is?_

- Put in money, it gives you the thing you requested. 

- Use a or b to select row, 0 or 1 to select slot. Not a large vending machine.

Most importantly was created with a Test Driven Developement approach. Tests were written from the perspective of someone interacting with the vending machine and that user's expected result.
